### 3. Social Media Sharing

- **Details:** Integrate social media sharing buttons (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) on each post to facilitate easy sharing. This will help increase the visibility of posts and attract a wider audience.

### 4. Enhanced Search Functionality
- **Objective:** Improve the search feature for better user experience.
- **Details:** Add filters for search results based on categories, tags, and date ranges. Implementing tags will also allow users to browse related content easily, making navigation through the blog more intuitive.
