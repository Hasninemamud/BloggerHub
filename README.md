## Future Enhancements

### 2. Commenting System

- **Details:** Implement a commenting feature that allows users to leave feedback or questions on blog posts. This can foster community engagement and discussions among readers.

### 3. Social Media Sharing
- **Objective:** Allow users to share blog posts on social media platforms.
- **Details:** Integrate social media sharing buttons (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) on each post to facilitate easy sharing. This will help increase the visibility of posts and attract a wider audience.

### 4. Enhanced Search Functionality
- **Objective:** Improve the search feature for better user experience.
- **Details:** Add filters for search results based on categories, tags, and date ranges. Implementing tags will also allow users to browse related content easily, making navigation through the blog more intuitive.
